Try a series of passwords on a disk you posess
==============================================

This is a little script which is capable of looping over the contents of a 
wordlist file sequentially. This is because I unabashedly forgot where the
capital and lower case letters are in the disk encryption password for my
desktop.

How to use it?
--------------

This will change, but for now, you put a file named wordlist.txt in the parent
directory and run the script with no arguments.
